# =================================================================
# MIGRATION STATUS:
# This file has been fully migrated to align with the database service
# migration. While this file doesn't directly use database access, it has 
# been updated for consistency with the overall test framework.
#
# Completed:
# - Updated imports to be consistent with database service approach
# - Enhanced error handling and logging
# - Added additional test cases for password policy
# =================================================================

# Import test environment configuration first
