# Key Rotation Implementation and Management

## Introduction

Key rotation represents a critical security practice in the SkinSpire encryption system. This document explains the implementation, management, and testing of the key rotation process. The system ensures continuous data protection while maintaining data accessibility during and after rotation events.

## Key Rotation Architecture

The key rotation system operates on three fundamental principles:

First, it maintains data availability throughout the rotation process. The system continues to function normally during key rotation, ensuring uninterrupted access to patient data and clinical operations.

Second, it preserves data integrity by carefully managing the transition between old and new encryption keys. Each piece of encrypted data maintains a clear association with its encryption key version.

Third, it provides comprehensive audit trails of all key rotation events, enabling security compliance and operational transparency.

## Implementation Details

The key rotation process involves several coordinated components:

```python
class KeyRotationManager:
    """Manages the key rotation process for hospital encryption keys"""
    
    def __init__(self, security_config: SecurityConfig):
        self.config = security_config
        self.encryption_handler = FieldEncryption(security_config)
        
    def initiate_key_rotation(self, hospital_id: str) -> Dict:
        """
        Initiates a key rotation process for a hospital.
        
        This method handles the entire key rotation workflow:
        1. Generates new encryption key
        2. Validates current system state
        3. Performs data re-encryption
        4. Updates key records
        5. Logs rotation event
        """
        try:
            # Generate new encryption key
            new_key = Fernet.generate_key()
            
            # Record rotation initiation
            rotation_record = self._create_rotation_record(
                hospital_id=hospital_id,
                new_key_id=str(uuid.uuid4())
            )
            
            # Perform rotation
            result = self._execute_rotation(
                hospital_id=hospital_id,
                new_key=new_key,
                rotation_record=rotation_record
            )
            
            return {
                'status': 'success',
                'rotation_id': rotation_record.id,
                'completion_time': datetime.utcnow()
            }
            
        except Exception as e:
            self._handle_rotation_error(e, hospital_id)
            raise KeyRotationError(f"Key rotation failed: {str(e)}")
Key Version Management
The system maintains a comprehensive record of key versions:
pythonCopyclass EncryptionKeyVersion:
    """Tracks encryption key versions and their lifecycle"""
    
    def __init__(self, hospital_id: str, key_data: bytes):
        self.hospital_id = hospital_id
        self.key_id = str(uuid.uuid4())
        self.creation_date = datetime.utcnow()
        self.activation_date = None
        self.retirement_date = None
        self._key_data = key_data
        self.status = 'pending'
    
    def activate(self):
        """Activates a new encryption key version"""
        self.activation_date = datetime.utcnow()
        self.status = 'active'
        
    def retire(self):
        """Retires an encryption key version"""
        self.retirement_date = datetime.utcnow()
        self.status = 'retired'
Rotation Process Flow
The key rotation process follows a carefully orchestrated sequence:

Preparation Phase

The system validates the current encryption state
It generates a new encryption key
It creates a rotation record for tracking


Execution Phase

The system identifies all encrypted data
It systematically re-encrypts data with the new key
It maintains transaction safety throughout


Verification Phase

The system validates all re-encrypted data
It confirms data accessibility
It verifies audit trail completeness



pythonCopydef _execute_rotation(self, hospital_id: str, new_key: bytes,
                     rotation_record: KeyRotationRecord) -> Dict:
    """
    Executes the key rotation process.
    """
    try:
        # Begin rotation transaction
        with self.session.begin_nested():
            # Re-encrypt all sensitive data
            updated_records = self._reencrypt_hospital_data(
                hospital_id=hospital_id,
                new_key=new_key
            )
            
            # Update key version records
            self._update_key_versions(
                hospital_id=hospital_id,
                new_key_id=rotation_record.id
            )
            
            # Verify rotation success
            self._verify_rotation(
                hospital_id=hospital_id,
                updated_records=updated_records
            )
            
            # Complete rotation record
            rotation_record.complete()
            
        return {
            'status': 'success',
            'updated_records': len(updated_records),
            'key_id': rotation_record.id
        }
        
    except Exception as e:
        rotation_record.fail(str(e))
        raise
Safety Mechanisms
The key rotation system implements multiple safety mechanisms:

Transaction Management
The system maintains data consistency through transaction controls:
pythonCopydef _reencrypt_hospital_data(self, hospital_id: str, new_key: bytes) -> List:
    """
    Re-encrypts all hospital data with new key using transactional safety.
    """
    with self.session.begin_nested():
        records = self._get_encrypted_records(hospital_id)
        for record in records:
            self._reencrypt_record(record, new_key)
        return records

Error Recovery
The system provides robust error handling and recovery:
pythonCopydef _handle_rotation_error(self, error: Exception, hospital_id: str):
    """
    Handles errors during key rotation process.
    """
    self.logger.error(f"Key rotation failed for hospital {hospital_id}")
    self.logger.error(f"Error: {str(error)}")
    
    # Record failure
    self._record_rotation_failure(hospital_id, error)
    
    # Notify administrators
    self._send_rotation_alert(hospital_id, error)


Monitoring and Verification
The system provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities:
pythonCopyclass RotationMonitor:
    """Monitors key rotation processes"""
    
    def __init__(self, hospital_id: str):
        self.hospital_id = hospital_id
        self.metrics = {}
        
    def track_progress(self, processed_records: int, total_records: int):
        """Tracks rotation progress"""
        self.metrics['progress'] = (processed_records / total_records) * 100
        self.metrics['last_update'] = datetime.utcnow()
        self._update_monitoring_data()
    
    def verify_completion(self) -> bool:
        """Verifies rotation completion status"""
        verification_result = self._verify_all_records()
        self.metrics['verification_status'] = verification_result
        return verification_result
Best Practices
When implementing key rotation, consider these essential practices:

Schedule rotations during low-activity periods to minimize impact on operations.
Maintain comprehensive backup procedures throughout the rotation process.
Implement monitoring systems to track rotation progress and success.
Establish clear communication protocols for stakeholders during rotation events.

Testing Considerations
Testing key rotation requires attention to several aspects:

Validate data consistency before and after rotation.
Verify proper handling of concurrent operations during rotation.
Confirm error recovery mechanisms function correctly.
Test monitoring and alerting systems thoroughly.
