# SkinSpire Clinic Hospital Management System
## User Management & Authentication Implementation Plan

### System Overview
SkinSpire Clinic Hospital Management System is designed as a multi-tenant healthcare platform that serves multiple hospitals and their branches. The system incorporates role-based access control, configurable authentication flows, and specialized patient and staff management features.

### Business rules
1. Phone number validation through SMS. Compulsary for staff as well as patient.  If the patient entry is through staff, the SMS validation can be overruled at hospital level
1.1 Similarly Email validation is also required. Compulsary for staff but can be disabled for a patient at hospital level 
2. Staff will have role based authorization and access. Patient will have single role
3. Super admin role will cut across hospitals
4. Super admin is the only person creating hospital records.  
5. Hospital admin role is for specific hospital but across branches.  
6. Super admin will create hospital admin registration and communicate through email with default password.  
7. Hospital admin will set up hospital portal with dashboard and invite users to register.  staff registration will go through approval process.   
8. patient registration is self service or hospital reception can do it. Branch will be a selection for patients.  
9. Branch is given by admin for staff
10. Staff can be associated with multiple branches for scheduling but will belong to one branch.  In the absence of specific branch, it will be a default branch.
11. Patient app will be specific for each hospital.  So hospital id is not a selection for patients.   Patient app need not take branch as an input.  It will be default / main branch.  However, if reception is entering the patient data, it will be for specific branch.
12. data partition or branch is optional.

### Role Based Authorization rules
1. users are assigned to roles
2. Roles are across branches but specific to hospital
3. Hospital admin assigns roles to user.  Initially every user logs into default role which has minimum access 
4. Complete configuration menu access is assigned to Hospital Admin
5. Screens / functionality / reports are grouped for functional area.
6. Roles are mapped to one or multiple functional area
7. Menu options change based on role
8. User Access will be for create / Edit / Read records.  Default is Read access and respective reports.
9. Management reports will be a functionality and can be assigned to a user. Normal reports are available for users based on their respective functional area assignmengt
10. validity period.   User access will be automaticaly disabled on staff end date
11. In case of patient wanting to opt out of their app, patient can choose whether he/she wants to purge his / her personal record and health record. The access gets disabled after this activity. 
12. user can save preferences for screen (like dark theme, what applets, reports they want to see in dashboard, email, sms notifications, marketing materials, receive offers, etc.)
  


### Role Hierarchy & Multi-Tenant Model

The system implements a hierarchical role structure:

1. **Super Admin**: System-wide administrative access
   - Manages hospital entities
   - Administers global system settings
   - Creates and manages Hospital Admin accounts

2. **Hospital Admin**: Hospital-specific administration
   - Manages all branches within their hospital
   - Approves staff registrations
   - Configures hospital-specific settings
   - Manages branch operations

3. **Staff**: Clinical and operational personnel
   - Primary association with one branch
   - Possible scheduling across multiple branches
   - Role-specific permissions and access
   - Subject to approval workflow

4. **Patient**: End users of medical services
   - Association with specific hospital
   - Optional branch association
   - Limited self-service capabilities
   - Can be registered by staff (reception)

### Key Authentication & Authorization Features

#### Phone Number Validation
- SMS-based verification system for users
- Configurable per hospital (can be enabled/disabled)
- OTP (One-Time Password) generation and verification
- Verification status tracking
- Grace period and retry mechanisms

#### Role-Based Authorization
- Pre-defined roles with specific permissions
- Hospital-specific role customization
- Permission inheritance and override capabilities
- Context-aware permission enforcement
- Activity logging and auditing

#### Multi-Tenant Data Partitioning
- Hospital-level data separation
- Branch-level access controls
- Cross-branch capabilities for authorized staff
- Data isolation for regulatory compliance

### Registration & Onboarding Workflows

#### Super Admin Registration
- System-initialized with seed super admin account
- Manual creation process for additional super admins
- Stringent verification and security protocols

#### Hospital Admin Registration
- Created by super admin
- Email notification with temporary credentials
- Required profile completion on first login
- Hospital-specific setup wizard

#### Staff Registration
- Self-registration with approval workflow
- Status tracking (pending, approved, rejected)
- Notification system for approval steps
- Document upload for credential verification
- Branch assignment by hospital admin

#### Patient Registration
- Self-service registration option
- Reception-assisted registration
- Minimal required information with progressive profiling
- Default branch assignment with override capability

### Branch Management

- Staff belong primarily to one branch
- Additional branch assignments for scheduling
- Default branch for hospitals with single location
- Branch transfer capabilities for both staff and patients
- Branch-specific operational settings

### Implementation Phases

1. **Foundation Phase**
   - Core user model implementation
   - Basic authentication flows
   - Role and permission structures
   - Hospital and branch models

2. **Role Management Phase**
   - RBAC implementation
   - Permission assignment
   - Role-based views and interfaces
   - Access control enforcement

3. **Approval Workflow Phase**
   - Staff approval process
   - Notification system
   - Status tracking
   - Admin review interfaces

4. **Verification Phase**
   - Phone verification integration
   - SMS gateway connection
   - Verification tracking
   - Hospital-specific settings

5. **Multi-Branch Phase**
   - Staff branch assignments
   - Scheduling across branches
   - Branch transfer workflows
   - Branch-specific configurations

6. **Patient Portal Phase**
   - Hospital-specific patient portals
   - Branded experiences
   - Appointment booking
   - Medical record access

### Technical Considerations

- Maintainable transaction boundaries
- Session management for long-running operations
- Consistent error handling
- Audit logging for sensitive operations
- Secure credential management
- Scalable multi-tenant architecture

### Security Measures

- Password policies with complexity requirements
- Two-factor authentication options
- Session timeout and management
- IP restrictions for sensitive operations
- Comprehensive audit trails
- Encrypted storage for sensitive data

This implementation plan provides a roadmap for developing a robust, secure, and flexible user management system for the SkinSpire Clinic Hospital Management System, addressing the specific requirements of a multi-tenant healthcare environment.
