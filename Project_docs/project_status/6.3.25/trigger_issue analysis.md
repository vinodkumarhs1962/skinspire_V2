Summary of Database Trigger Issues and Next Steps
Current Status
We've successfully updated the test files to work with your current database setup, but the database triggers we implemented aren't functioning as expected. Here's a summary of the issues:
1. Password Hashing Trigger Not Working: The triggers for automatically hashing passwords during insert/update operations on the users table aren't taking effect.
2. Role Deletion Cascade Not Working: The trigger meant to automatically delete related UserRoleMapping records when a User is deleted isn't functioning.
3. Trigger Application Issue: The create_audit_triggers_all_schemas() function is applying the triggers in principle, but they don't seem to be properly active.
Root Causes
Based on our investigation, there are several likely causes:
1. PostgreSQL Extension Issues: The password hashing trigger requires the pgcrypto extension which might not be properly installed or available.
2. Schema Mismatch: The triggers might be created in schemas that don't match where your tables actually reside.
3. Trigger Creation Timing: Triggers might be created before the tables they're supposed to act on, causing them to be skipped.
4. Permissions Problems: The database user might lack sufficient permissions to create or execute triggers.
5. Trigger Syntax/Implementation Issues: There could be syntax problems in the trigger definitions that prevent them from working correctly.
Next Steps
For your next work session, here are the recommended steps:
1. Verify Trigger Existence:


Copy
sql
Copy
SELECT * FROM pg_trigger;
2. Check the PostgreSQL Extensions:


Copy
sql
Copy
SELECT * FROM pg_extension;
3. Analyze Trigger Creation Messages:
   * Set logging level to DEBUG
   * Run trigger creation and capture output
   * Look for specific error messages
4. Try Manual Trigger Creation:
   * Manually create one trigger on a specific table
   * Test if it functions as expected
5. Implement Database Constraints:
   * Add ON DELETE CASCADE to foreign keys instead of relying on triggers
   * Example: FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
6. Create a Triggers Verification Tool:
   * Implement the verification script we discussed
   * Run it periodically to check trigger health
7. Investigate PostgreSQL Permissions:
   * Check if the database user has the correct permissions
   * May need superuser access for some extensions
Alternative Approaches
If trigger-based solutions continue to be problematic:
1. Application-Level Validation: Keep business rules in the application layer rather than triggers.
2. Foreign Key Constraints: Use database-level constraints for relationships instead of custom triggers.
3. Event Listeners: Use SQLAlchemy event listeners which run before/after database operations.
4. Stored Procedures: Move complex logic to stored procedures which have different permission requirements.
5. Data Integrity Checks: Implement periodic integrity checks that identify and fix inconsistencies.
This strategic approach will help you determine why the triggers aren't working and provide alternative solutions to achieve the same data integrity and business rule validation goals.
