# Skinspire Hospital Management System - Implementation Plan

## 1. Database Layer Improvements

### 1.1 Fix Trigger Issues
- **Verify PostgreSQL Extension Installation**
  - Ensure `pgcrypto` extension is installed and available
  - Add installation check in application startup
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
  ```

- **Implement Trigger Verification System**
  - Create a dedicated script to verify trigger existence and functionality
  - Add periodic trigger health checks
  ```python
  def verify_triggers():
      """Check if all required triggers are correctly installed and functioning."""
      trigger_checks = [
          ("users_password_hash_insert", "users"),
          ("users_password_hash_update", "users"),
          ("user_role_cascade_delete", "users"),
          # Add more trigger checks as needed
      ]
      
      results = {}
      for trigger_name, table_name in trigger_checks:
          # Check if trigger exists
          trigger_exists = db.session.execute(text(
              "SELECT 1 FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = :name"
          ), {"name": trigger_name}).scalar() is not None
          
          results[trigger_name] = {
              "exists": trigger_exists,
              "table": table_name
          }
      
      return results
  ```

- **Alternative to Triggers Using SQLAlchemy Events**
  - Implement password hashing using SQLAlchemy event listeners
  ```python
  @event.listens_for(User, 'before_insert')
  def hash_password_before_insert(mapper, connection, target):
      if target.password and not target.password.startswith('$2b$'):
          target.password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(target.password).decode('utf-8')
          
  @event.listens_for(User, 'before_update')
  def hash_password_before_update(mapper, connection, target):
      if target.password and not target.password.startswith('$2b$'):
          target.password = bcrypt.generate_password_hash(target.password).decode('utf-8')
  ```

- **Use Database Constraints Instead of Triggers**
  - Implement cascading deletes with foreign key constraints
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE user_role_mapping
  ADD CONSTRAINT fk_user_role_user_id 
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
  ```
