Sessions, Queries, and Objects in SQLAlchemy
1. The Session
A SQLAlchemy session is a workspace for your database operations. It:

Maintains a connection to the database
Tracks changes to your objects (the "identity map")
Manages transactions
Handles the conversion between Python objects and database rows

Think of a session as your "database conversation context" - while you have an active session, any database objects you retrieve are managed by that session.
2. Queries
Queries are operations that run within a session. When you do:
pythonCopysession.query(User).filter_by(user_id='12345').first()
You're creating a query that:

Uses the connection from your session
Fetches data from the database
Returns objects that are bound to that session

The key point is that the objects returned by a query are attached to the session that created the query. They become "session-managed" objects.
3. Session Attachment and Detachment
When an object is:

Attached: It's associated with a session and can access its attributes safely
Detached: It's no longer connected to any session and can't safely access attributes that require database access

Objects become detached when:

The session they were attached to is closed
They're explicitly removed from a session
They're serialized/deserialized (like when passing between processes)

4. The Root Problem in Your Code
In your code, what's happening is:

The token_required decorator creates a session
It validates the token and gets a user object that's attached to that session
When the decorator's context ends, the session is closed automatically
The user object becomes detached
The route handler tries to use that detached user object, causing the error

5. Why Your Fix Isn't Working
Your current fix tries to create a fresh query for the user:
pythonCopyuser = session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=current_user.user_id).first()
But to do this, you first need to access current_user.user_id - and that's where the error happens, because current_user is already detached.
6. The Solution
The solution is to pass only the user_id string from the decorator to the route handler, not the user object itself:
pythonCopy# In decorator:
user_id = user.user_id  # Get the ID as a string while session is still open
return f(user_id, session, *args, **kwargs)  # Pass ID instead of user object

# In route handler:
def get_user_profile(user_id, session):
    # Query for a fresh user using the ID
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
    # Now user is attached to the current session
This works because:

We extract just the user_id (a string) while the session is still active
Strings don't get "detached" - they're just strings
The route handler uses its own session to query for a fresh user object
That fresh user object is properly attached to the current session

User Session Lifecycle in Flask with Your Database Service
In your application architecture with the database_service.py approach, here's how the session lifecycle works:
1. Session Creation
A database session is created in one of these ways:

Context Manager: When you use with get_db_session() as session:
Decorator: When the @token_required decorator is applied to a route

2. Session Lifespan
The key thing to understand is that a session only lives within its creation context:

For context managers, the session lives only within the with block
For decorators, the session lives only during the decorator's execution

Once execution exits that context, the session is automatically closed, and all objects attached to it become detached.
3. Session Boundaries in Request Handling
In a typical Flask request flow:

Request comes in
@token_required decorator runs:

Creates Session A
Validates token, gets user
Passes user_id and a new Session B to your route handler
Session A is closed when decorator finishes


Route handler runs with Session B:

Uses Session B for all database operations
When route handler finishes, Session B is closed


Response is returned

4. Multiple Methods Using Sessions
When you have multiple methods called within a single request, there are two approaches:
Option 1: Pass the Session (Your Current Approach)
pythonCopy@token_required
def route_handler(user_id, session):
    # Session provided by decorator
    user = session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
    
    # Pass the same session to helper functions
    result = helper_function(user, session)
    return jsonify(result)

def helper_function(user, session):
    # Uses the same session passed from the route handler
    data = session.query(SomeData).filter_by(user_id=user.user_id).all()
    return process_data(data)
This approach ensures a single session is used throughout the request lifecycle.
Option 2: Create New Sessions as Needed
pythonCopydef helper_function(user_id):
    # Creates its own session
    with get_db_session() as session:
        data = session.query(SomeData).filter_by(user_id=user_id).all()
        return process_data(data)
This approach creates independent sessions for each function, which can be simpler but less efficient.
5. Best Practice
For web applications, the best practice is:

Create one session per request
Pass that session to all methods that need database access
Let the session close automatically when the request completes

This is exactly what your current architecture with @token_required does, where the decorator creates a session and passes it to your route handler.
6. Implementation Significance
The change I'm suggesting to pass user_id instead of the user object from the decorator doesn't change this session management approach. It just ensures that:

We don't try to use detached objects across session boundaries
Each function queries for fresh, session-attached objects as needed

You'll still have exactly one session per request, with the session being passed from the decorator to your route handler and any helper functions.
