Lessons Learned and Development Insights
1. CSRF Token Issue Resolution
Problem: Form submissions were failing with CSRF token validation errors.
Solution: Used render_template_string with an explicitly generated CSRF token.
Lessons:

When returning HTML directly as strings (not using Jinja2 templates), variables like {{ csrf_token() }} aren't processed.
Use render_template_string for simple template responses.
For diagnostic routes, consider using csrf_exempt decorator.
Always check logs for "CSRF token is invalid" errors when forms fail to submit.

2. Patient ID Not Found Error
Problem: Patient name was found but ID wasn't properly set in the form.
Solution: Improved patient lookup with better SQL queries and multiple fallback mechanisms.
Lessons:

Implement multiple search strategies (exact match, partial match, etc.)
Always provide clear error messages to the user when lookups fail
Store IDs in multiple places (hidden fields, data attributes) for redundancy
Log critical information during the form processing to trace the patient ID flow

3. Database Field/Model Discrepancies
Problem: Code was referring to Medicine.name but the actual field was Medicine.medicine_name.
Solution: Corrected field references to match the actual database schema.
Lessons:

Always refer to your model definitions when writing queries
Common naming pattern differences to watch for:

Short vs. descriptive names (e.g., name vs medicine_name)
Singular vs. plural (e.g., batch vs batches)
Prefixed vs. non-prefixed (e.g., id vs medicine_id)


Use IDE features to navigate to model definitions when unsure

4. PostgreSQL Variable Naming Conflicts
Problem: Ambiguous column references when variable names matched column names.
Solution: Used prefixed variable names (v_hospital_id instead of hospital_id).
Lessons:

Prefix variables with v_ to distinguish them from column names
Always qualify ambiguous column references in queries (e.g., tablename.column_name)
Be cautious when using column names as variable names in procedural code

5. API-Based Fallback Mechanism Issues
Problem: Recursion error when trying to use test request context for API-based fallback.
Solution: Replaced with direct service function calls instead of mock requests.
Lessons:

Avoid creating request contexts within request handlers
Prefer direct function calls over mock requests
Design your API to be callable programmatically, not just via HTTP
Use clear separation between service logic and HTTP interfaces

6. General Development Best Practices

Incremental Changes: Make small testable changes rather than large rewrites
Detailed Logging: Log key variables, especially for form processing flows
Error Handling: Use specific error messages that point to the root cause
Validation: Add validation at multiple levels (client-side, server-side)
Defensive Programming: Check for nulls, handle unexpected inputs
Use Database Models Correctly: Understand your ORM and model relationships
Testing: Create diagnostic endpoints for testing specific functionality
Environment Consistency: Ensure development matches production closely

By applying these lessons, you'll be better prepared to identify and resolve similar issues in the future. The key is to have a systematic approach to debugging, with proper logging at critical points in your application's flow.
