Implementation Summary and Next Steps
I've implemented several core business process services and components for the SkinSpire Hospital Management System, focusing on the billing, inventory, supplier, and financial modules. Here's a summary of what has been accomplished and how it maintains compatibility with the existing system architecture.
Services Implemented

Billing Service

Comprehensive invoice creation and management
Payment processing with multiple payment methods
GST-compliant tax calculations
Multi-currency support with exchange rate handling
Timezone-aware transaction timestamping


GL Service

Financial transaction processing
GL entry creation for various business transactions
GST ledger maintenance for tax reporting
Account reconciliation support


Inventory Service

FIFO-based batch management
Stock movement tracking
Expiry management
Multi-location support
Consumption tracking for services


Supplier Service

Supplier management with GST compliance
Purchase order processing
Supplier invoice handling
Payment processing



Implementation Adherence to Guidelines
All implementations follow the established project standards:

Multi-tenant Architecture

All services use the hospital_id as a partition key
Functions accept hospital_id as a parameter
All database queries are scoped by hospital_id


Database Access

Using the centralized get_db_session() pattern for database access
Proper session handling with context managers
Transaction management with proper commit/rollback


Error Handling

Consistent error logging with context
Proper exception handling and user feedback
Transaction safety with rollbacks on errors


Form and View Structure

Forms follow the established Flask-WTF pattern
Views use the blueprint structure
Permission checking with decorators


Timezone and Internationalization

All datetime fields use timezone-aware timestamps
Currency handling with exchange rates
Proper decimal handling for financial calculations



Compatibility with Existing System

Authentication Integration

Views utilize the existing login_required decorator
User authorization checks via permissions_required
Access to current_user for identifying the active user


UI Integration

Views provide menu_items for the dashboard
Using the existing dashboard.html template structure
Following the established CSS structure with Tailwind


Database Model Extension

New models extend the existing Base classes
Maintaining TimestampMixin and TenantMixin usage
Following established naming conventions



Next Steps

HTML Templates

Create the remaining HTML templates for invoice creation, viewing, and management
Create supplier and inventory management interfaces
Ensure dark/light theme support across all templates


API Implementation

Complete the REST API endpoints for mobile access
Implement batch processing APIs for bulk operations


Report Generation

Implement invoice printing with ReportLab
Create financial reports for accounting
Implement inventory reports (stock level, expiry, etc.)


Testing

Create unit tests for all services
Implement integration tests for end-to-end flows
Test across different database environments


Documentation

Update user documentation for the new modules
Document API endpoints for integration
Create admin guides for configuration



Development Guidelines for Future Work
When continuing development in future chats, remember to:

Always check existing code first

Review existing services, forms, and templates
Understand the established patterns before making changes
Use the same session handling patterns consistently


Maintain backward compatibility

Don't modify existing function signatures
Add optional parameters for new features
Keep existing field names and types intact


Follow the project structure

Place services in the app/services directory
Place views in the app/views directory
Place forms in the app/forms directory
Place templates in the app/templates directory with proper subdirectories


Use the established authentication system

Leverage current_user for user identification
Use permission checking decorators for access control
Maintain audit trails for operations


Maintain multi-tenant separation

Always filter by hospital_id in database queries
Include hospital_id in all service function signatures
Use the TenantMixin for new models

By following these guidelines, we ensure that the new modules integrate seamlessly with the existing system while maintaining its architectural integrity and security model.
