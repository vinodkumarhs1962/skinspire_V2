Core Business Processes Approach Document
Overview
Based on your requirements, I'll focus on the following core business processes:

Billing & Collection for Services and Pharmacy
Inventory Management
Supplier Invoice & Payment Processing
Basic GL Framework for Financial Transactions
Required Master Data Management

Current Architecture Assessment
Your SkinSpire Hospital Management System has a solid foundation with:

Python/Flask backend with PostgreSQL database
SQLAlchemy ORM for database operations
Authentication system implemented
Security mechanisms in place (encryption, CSRF, etc.)
Modular design with clear separation of concerns

Data Model Analysis
Key Entities & Relationships
Below is a conceptual model of the core entities needed for the processes you want to implement:
MASTER DATA
- PACKAGE_FAMILY --> PACKAGES --> SERVICES
- MANUFACTURER --> MEDICINE_MASTER
- SUPPLIER_MASTER
- GL_ACCOUNT_MASTER

TRANSACTION DATA
- INVOICE (Header/Details)
- PURCHASE_ORDER (Header/Line Items)
- SUPPLIER_INVOICE
- INVENTORY
- GL_TRANSACTIONS
Process Flow Diagrams
1. Billing & Collection Flow
Patient/Service Selection → Package/Service Selection → 
Generate Invoice → Payment Processing → 
Update GL Entries → Generate Receipt
2. Inventory Management Flow
Stock Entry/Receipt → Stock Adjustment → 
Inventory Valuation (FIFO) → Expiry Tracking → 
Reorder Management → Inventory Reports
3. Supplier Invoice & Payment Flow
Create Purchase Order → Supplier Confirmation → 
Goods Receipt → Supplier Invoice Recording → 
Invoice Verification → Payment Processing → GL Entry
4. GL Transaction Flow
Source Transaction → GL Mapping → GL Entry Creation → 
Account Balance Update → Financial Reports

Implementation Approach
1. Database Implementation

Phase 1: Master Tables

Implement all master tables first
Create database migrations
Set up validation rules and constraints


Phase 2: Transaction Tables

Implement transaction tables
Set up foreign key relationships
Implement triggers for inventory movement tracking


Phase 3: Views and Functions

Create necessary views for reporting
Implement stored functions for complex calculations
Set up triggers for GL entries



2. Application Layer

Models

Create SQLAlchemy models for all tables
Implement business logic validations
Set up relationships between models


Services

Implement service modules for each business process
Create classes for transaction processing
Build inventory calculation service


API Endpoints

Create REST endpoints for all operations
Implement proper authentication and authorization
Set up validation and error handling



3. UI Implementation

Master Data Management

Create screens for master data management
Implement CRUD operations with validation


Transaction Screens

Build invoice generation screen
Implement purchase order creation
Create supplier invoice processing


Reports and Analytics

Implement inventory status reports
Create financial statements
Build dashboards for key metrics



Best Practices and Recommendations

Database Design

Use JSONB columns for flexible data storage (contact info, etc.)
Implement proper indexing for performance
Use triggers for maintaining data integrity


Business Logic

Keep core logic in service layer
Use SQLAlchemy for simple queries and native SQL for complex ones
Implement proper transaction management


Financial Considerations

Maintain double-entry accounting principles
Implement proper reconciliation mechanisms
Create audit trails for all financial transactions


Security

Extend your existing authentication to implement role-based access control
Encrypt sensitive financial information
Log all critical operations


Performance

Implement database partitioning for large tables
Create summary tables for reporting
Use caching for frequent operations



Phased Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)

Set up master data structures
Implement basic models and services
Create initial UI screens for master data

Phase 2: Core Transactions (Weeks 3-4)

Implement billing and invoice generation
Set up inventory management
Create purchase order processing

Phase 3: Financial Integration (Weeks 5-6)

Implement GL entry generation
Create financial reports
Set up supplier invoice processing

Phase 4: Refinement (Weeks 7-8)

Implement advanced features
Performance optimization
User experience refinements

Integration Considerations

Patient Management Integration

Link patient records to invoices
Connect services to treatment plans


User Authorization

Define role-based access for financial operations
Set up approval workflows for purchases


Reporting Integration

Connect with ReportLab for generating PDF reports
Set up data export capabilities



Conclusion
This approach provides a structured way to implement the core business processes you've prioritized. It builds on your existing architecture while ensuring scalability for future enhancements.
