## Guidelines Compliance

The implemented code follows the SkinSpire Clinic HMS Technical Development Guidelines in the following ways:

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- All database operations include `hospital_id` as a parameter
- Views consistently use `current_user.hospital_id` to maintain tenant isolation
- All forms, templates, and service calls maintain the multi-tenant design

### 2. Database Layer Compliance

- All database operations use the centralized `get_db_session()` pattern
- Proper session handling with context managers (`with` statements)
- Consistent use of transaction management with proper commits/rollbacks

### 3. Error Handling

- Comprehensive try/except blocks in all view functions
- Consistent error logging with context information
- User-friendly error messages through flash notifications
- Graceful transaction handling with rollbacks on errors

### 4. Form Handling

- All forms use Flask-WTF for CSRF protection
- Input validation with appropriate validators
- Consistent error display in templates
- Field-specific error messages

### 5. Security Implementation

- Login required decorators on all sensitive routes
- Permission checking with `permissions_required` decorator
- Role-based access control for all operations

### 6. UI Design

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Consistent dark/light theme support
- Component-based architecture for reusable elements
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement

### 7. JavaScript Implementation

- Clean separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture
- Progressive enhancement for non-JS browsers
- AJAX requests for dynamic content
