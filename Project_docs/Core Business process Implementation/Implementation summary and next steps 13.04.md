### Integration Updates

- Update `app/init.py` to register the new blueprints
- Update `app/utils/menu_utils.py` to add menu items for new modules

## Guidelines Compliance

The implemented code follows the SkinSpire Clinic HMS Technical Development Guidelines in the following ways:

### 1. Multi-Tenant Architecture

- All database operations include `hospital_id` as a parameter
- Views consistently use `current_user.hospital_id` to maintain tenant isolation
- All forms, templates, and service calls maintain the multi-tenant design

### 2. Database Layer Compliance

- All database operations use the centralized `get_db_session()` pattern
- Proper session handling with context managers (`with` statements)
- Consistent use of transaction management with proper commits/rollbacks

### 3. Error Handling

- Comprehensive try/except blocks in all view functions
- Consistent error logging with context information
- User-friendly error messages through flash notifications
- Graceful transaction handling with rollbacks on errors

### 4. Form Handling

- All forms use Flask-WTF for CSRF protection
- Input validation with appropriate validators
- Consistent error display in templates
- Field-specific error messages

### 5. Security Implementation

- Login required decorators on all sensitive routes
- Permission checking with `permission_required` decorator
- Role-based access control for all operations

### 6. UI Design

- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Consistent dark/light theme support
- Component-based architecture for reusable elements
- Mobile-first approach with progressive enhancement

### 7. JavaScript Implementation

- Clean separation of concerns
- Event-driven architecture
- Progressive enhancement for non-JS browsers
- AJAX requests for dynamic content

## Next Steps

### Template Files to Complete


### Service Implementation

Ensure all service functions referenced in the view files are fully implemented:

- `app/services/inventory_service.py`
- `app/services/supplier_service.py`
- `app/services/gl_service.py`



### Testing

- Create unit tests for all service functions
- Create integration tests for views and API endpoints
- Test across different database environments

### Documentation

- Update technical documentation to include the new modules
- Create user documentation for the new features

## Development Guidelines for Future Work

When continuing development in future chats, remember to:

1. **Always check existing code first**
   - Review existing services, forms, and templates
   - Understand the established patterns before making changes
   - Use the same session handling patterns consistently

2. **Maintain backward compatibility**
   - Don't modify existing function signatures
   - Add optional parameters for new features
   - Keep existing field names and types intact

3. **Follow the project structure**
   - Place services in the app/services directory
   - Place views in the app/views directory
   - Place forms in the app/forms directory
   - Place templates in the app/templates directory with proper subdirectories

4. **Use the established authentication system**
   - Leverage current_user for user identification
   - Use permission checking decorators for access control
   - Maintain audit trails for operations

5. **Maintain multi-tenant separation**
   - Always filter by hospital_id in database queries
   - Include hospital_id in all service function signatures
   - Use the TenantMixin for new models

By following these guidelines, we ensure that the new modules integrate seamlessly with the existing system while maintaining its architectural integrity and security model.
