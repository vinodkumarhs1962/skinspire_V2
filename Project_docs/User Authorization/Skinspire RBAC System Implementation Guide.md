# Skinspire RBAC System Implementation Guide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system implementation for the Skinspire clinic management system. The RBAC system provides multi-branch access control, ensuring that users only see and can modify data appropriate to their roles and branch assignments.

**Current Status**: Branch-aware infrastructure is implemented. User interface components are ready. Full RBAC administration interface pending.

## 1. What is Already Implemented  

### 1.1 Core Infrastructure

**Branch Service Layer**
-   `branch_service.py` - Complete branch context determination
-   Testing user bypass logic (user ID: 7777777777)
-   Multi-branch user detection and access control
-   Branch filtering for data queries

**Permission Framework**
-   `permission_service.py` - Permission validation engine
-   Decorator-based access control (`@require_web_branch_permission`)
-   Module-action permission model (e.g., 'supplier', 'view')
-   Hospital-level data isolation

**Database Layer**
-   Branch-aware data models with `branch_id` foreign keys
-   Hospital isolation in all core tables
-   User-branch association tables

### 1.2 UI Components (Branch-Aware)

**Reusable Components**
-   `branch_filter.html` - Smart filtering dropdown
-   `branch_indicator.html` - Branch display badges
-   `branch_info_display.html` - Detailed branch information
-   `branch_selector.html` - Advanced branch selection

**Template Integration**
-   Supplier management (list, view, edit)
-   Purchase order management (list, view)
-   Supplier invoice management (list, view)
-   Responsive design with mobile-friendly branch columns

### 1.3 Security Features

**Access Control**
-   Hospital-level data isolation (users cannot access other hospitals' data)
-   Branch-level filtering based on user assignments
-   Decorator-based endpoint protection
-   Testing bypass for development/debugging

**Data Protection**
-   All database queries filtered by hospital_id
-   Branch context automatically applied to data retrieval
-   Cross-branch data access prevented for unauthorized users

## 2. What Needs to be Done (Immediate) üîß

### 2.1 RBAC Configuration Resolution

**Branch Context Issues**
- üîß Investigate why branch components show `method: none` instead of proper branch context
- üîß Verify testing user bypass logic is working correctly across all modules
- üîß Ensure branch context is properly passed from decorators to templates

**Data Verification**
- üîß Confirm all business objects (suppliers, purchase orders, invoices) contain `branch_name` field
- üîß Verify branch filtering is working correctly for non-testing users
- üîß Test multi-branch user scenarios

### 2.2 Template Completion

**Remaining Modules**
- üîß Apply branch awareness to inventory management templates
- üîß Update patient management templates (when implemented)
- üîß Ensure all new modules follow the branch-aware template pattern

**Standardization**
- üîß Create template development guidelines for branch integration
- üîß Document the standard pattern for branch column implementation

## 4. Development Guidelines (Avoiding Rework) üìã

### 4.1 For New Module Development

**Template Pattern**
```html
<!-- Always include branch context in render_template calls -->
return render_template(
    'module/template.html',
    data=data,
    branch_context=getattr(g, 'branch_context', None)  # Required
)

<!-- Standard branch column in list templates -->
<th class="hidden lg:table-cell px-6 py-3 text-xs font-medium text-gray-500 uppercase">
    Branch
</th>

<!-- Standard branch cell in list templates -->
<td class="hidden lg:table-cell px-6 py-4 text-sm text-gray-500">
    {% if item.get('branch_name') %}
        {% set branch_name = item.branch_name %}
        {% include 'components/branch/branch_indicator.html' %}
    {% else %}
        <span class="text-gray-400">-</span>
    {% endif %}
</td>

<!-- Standard branch filter in search forms -->
<div class="w-full md:w-1/5">
    {% include 'components/branch/branch_filter.html' %}
</div>
```

**Backend Pattern**
```python
# Always use the permission decorator
@require_web_branch_permission('module_name', 'action_name')
def view_function():
    # Decorator automatically sets g.branch_context
    
    # For data filtering, use the decorator's branch context
    branch_uuid = getattr(g, 'branch_uuid', None)
    
    # Service calls should include branch filtering
    result = service.search_data(
        hospital_id=current_user.hospital_id,
        branch_id=branch_uuid,  # Automatic branch filtering
        # ... other parameters
    )
    
    # Always pass branch_context to template
    return render_template(
        'template.html',
        data=result,
        branch_context=getattr(g, 'branch_context', None)
    )
```

### 4.2 Database Design Guidelines

**New Tables**
```sql
-- All business data tables must include:
hospital_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES hospitals(hospital_id),
branch_id UUID REFERENCES branches(branch_id),
created_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(user_id),
created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
updated_by UUID REFERENCES users(user_id),
updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_table_hospital_branch ON table_name(hospital_id, branch_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_table_hospital_created ON table_name(hospital_id, created_at);
```

**Service Layer Pattern**
```python
def search_entity(hospital_id, branch_id=None, **filters):
    """
    Standard pattern for all search functions
    
    Args:
        hospital_id: Required - ensures hospital isolation
        branch_id: Optional - None means show all branches user can access
        **filters: Other search criteria
    """
    query = Entity.query.filter_by(hospital_id=hospital_id)
    
    if branch_id:
        query = query.filter_by(branch_id=branch_id)
    
    # Apply other filters...
    return query.all()
```

### 4.3 Security Checklist for New Features

**Required for Every New Endpoint**
- [ ] `@require_web_branch_permission` decorator applied
- [ ] Hospital ID validation in service layer
- [ ] Branch context passed to template
- [ ] Data queries filtered by hospital_id
- [ ] Branch filtering applied when branch_id provided
- [ ] Error handling for permission failures
- [ ] Logging for access attempts

**Required for Every New Template**
- [ ] Branch filter component included in search forms
- [ ] Branch column added to list tables (with responsive hiding)
- [ ] Branch information shown in detail views
- [ ] Mobile-friendly responsive design
- [ ] Graceful degradation when branch data unavailable

## 5. Current Known Issues & Workarounds üêõ

### 5.1 Testing User Branch Context

**Issue**: Testing user (7777777777) shows `branch_context method: none`
**Impact**: Branch columns not visible during development testing
**Workaround**: RBAC system is working correctly; issue is with testing user configuration
**Resolution**: Will be resolved when RBAC administration interface is implemented

### 5.2 Data Filtering for Testing User

**Issue**: Testing user sees filtered results instead of all data
**Root Cause**: Branch filtering applied even with testing bypass
**Workaround**: Manual override implemented in supplier_list function
**Resolution**: Systematic testing user bypass needs implementation across all modules

## Conclusion

The Skinspire RBAC system has a solid foundation with branch-aware infrastructure, security decorators, and UI components fully implemented. The current architecture will support future RBAC administration features without requiring significant rework of existing code.

**Key Strength**: The decorator-based approach and reusable components ensure that new modules automatically inherit proper branch awareness and security controls.

**Next Priority**: Resolve the testing user branch context issue and implement the RBAC administration interface to complete the system.

The codebase is well-positioned for future enhancement while maintaining security and preventing the need for architectural changes.
