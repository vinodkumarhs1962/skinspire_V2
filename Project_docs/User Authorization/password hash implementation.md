# Password Hashing Implementation Documentation for SkinSpire Hospital Management System

## Overview

This document details the implementation of password hashing in the SkinSpire Hospital Management System. The system uses Werkzeug's password hashing functions within the Python application layer, replacing the previous PostgreSQL trigger-based approach.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Password Hashing Mechanism

The system now uses the Werkzeug security library to handle password hashing. This implementation:

- Uses industry-standard cryptographic functions
- Generates secure password hashes with salting
- Provides simple and reliable verification
- Is maintained as part of the Flask ecosystem

### 2. User Model Implementation

The password handling functionality is implemented in the `User` model (in `app/models/transaction.py`):

```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash

class User(Base, TimestampMixin, SoftDeleteMixin):
    # ... other model attributes and methods ...
    
    def set_password(self, password):
        """Set password hash using werkzeug"""
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)
    
    def check_password(self, password):
        """Check password against hash using werkzeug"""
        if not self.password_hash or not password:
            return False
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)
```

### 3. Database Configuration

The database-level password hashing trigger has been disabled in favor of the application-level approach:

- The `hash_password()` function in the database is kept for backward compatibility but modified to be a no-op
- Trigger creation for password hashing is disabled in the SQL setup files
- Clear comments in the SQL files explain that password hashing is now handled by Werkzeug in Python

### 4. Usage in Application Code

#### Creating New Users

When creating a new user:

```python
user = User(
    user_id="example_user",
    hospital_id=hospital_id,
    entity_type="staff",
    entity_id=entity_id,
    is_active=True
)
user.set_password("secure_password")
session.add(user)
session.commit()
```

#### Updating User Passwords

When updating a user's password:

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=user_id).first()
user.set_password(new_password)
session.commit()
```

#### Authenticating Users

When verifying a user's password during login:

```python
user = session.query(User).filter_by(user_id=username).first()
if user and user.check_password(password):
    # Authentication successful
    # Proceed with login process
```

## Security Considerations

### Password Hash Format

The system uses Werkzeug's default hashing algorithm, which may be:
- `pbkdf2:sha256` (in older versions)
- `scrypt` (in newer versions)

Both are cryptographically secure with appropriate salting and iterations.

### Migration Considerations

The system can handle passwords hashed by either:
- The new Werkzeug method
- Legacy passwords hashed by the PostgreSQL trigger (bcrypt format starting with `$2`)

This provides backward compatibility during migration.

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simplicity**: Uses established libraries with straightforward API
2. **Consistency**: All password operations use the same method
3. **Maintainability**: Logic centralized in the User model
4. **Testability**: Easier to test without database dependencies
5. **Portability**: Not tied to PostgreSQL-specific extensions

## Verification and Testing

Password hashing functionality is verified through:

1. Unit tests in `tests/test_security/test_user_management.py`
2. Integration tests in `tests/test_security/test_authentication.py`

These tests confirm that:
- Passwords are properly hashed when set
- Hashed passwords can be verified
- Authentication flows work correctly

## Best Practices for Password Management

When working with this system:

1. Always use the `set_password()` method when creating or updating passwords
2. Never store plain-text passwords
3. Never modify the `password_hash` field directly
4. Use the `check_password()` method for verification instead of direct comparison
