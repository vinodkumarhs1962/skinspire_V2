- Please follow comprehensive development Guidelines described in SkinSpire Clinic HMS Technical Development Guidelines v2.0 
- This document provides projct best practices for handling critical errors and standards and approaches to be followed

### Core Communication Principles
- Prioritize incremental, backward-compatible improvements
- Preserve existing code structure and functionality
- Provide minimal invasive, targeted solutions
- Maintain clear, precise communication


### Improvement Approach
- Keyword: "Incrementally improve"
- Maintain existing module interfaces
- Ensure consumer modules remain unaffected
- Explicitly highlight potential impacts

### Error Handling
- Fix ONLY the specific error
- No bundled improvements or refactoring
- Modify only error-related lines
- Provide minimal, targeted solutions

### Context and Understanding
- Carefully review all provided modules in attachments or in Project knowledge area
- Ask for clarification if context is unclear
- Verify project structure before suggesting changes
- Reference attached modules in recommendations
- Please dont assume variables names, routes, methods in other artifacts  
- Please ask if you do not find in attached documents or Project kknowledge

### Problem-Solving Method
1. Understand current implementation
2. Identify precise issue
3. Propose minimal solution
4. Explain rationale
5. Highlight potential consequences

### Key Guiding Phrases
- "Incrementally improve"
- "Maintain existing structure"
- "Backward compatible enhancement"

### Important Considerations
- Prioritize existing code integrity
- Minimize disruption to current system
- Provide clear, step-by-step explanations
